          My name is Coriana Williams and I am from Alabama but residing in Georgia. I got stationed in Georgia in 2017 and post military obligations desided to remain here for work opportunities in the Information Technologies community. Before becoming an Anaylst, I worked as a Human Resource specialist while persuing a Technical College for general studies at night. This would be my second time attending school, 2011 being the first at the University of South alabama.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>I've spend a good amount of time trying to figure out what my career purpose and home would be. Taking into account locations, earnings, and overall happiness I was drawn to the development community. My goal is to be happy with my decision, and to finish what I start with this career choice. Taking these steps to get started wasn't easy on my part, mainly because of self dought and lack of motivation but I am here and I am ready for the experience. This journey is mine, it is personal and I will not be overcome by lack of confidence anymore. My goal is to trust myself, stay focused, and to fall in love with the process!

          My name is Kaeden and I'm currently a full time student here at Code Fellows. I am switching careers and pursuing knowledge within the tech industry. The majority of my working career has consisted of labor instensive work. I worked for United Parcel Service (UPS) right out of highschool, and put in around 6 to 7 years there. I worked in the warehouse and also was a package delivery driver. I decided that I wanted my work/life balance to change and I also wanted to challenge myself with software development.

           Hi, I'm Jeanette Leyva, I am a Navy Veteran of 9 years. I recently got out the military to pursue a different career path. 
           I am student at Code Fellows and soon to be enrolled in UC San Diego to pursue a computer science degree. 
           I wanted to get into software development for game design and development. I fell in love with video games when I was five.
           The first few videos games that shaped my childhood were Marvel vs Capcom, Super Mario 64, Banjo Kazooie, Star Wars Ep 1: Racer, Medal of Honor and 
           Donkey Kong.<br> I think I fell in love with video games because of my competitive nature and my love for problem solving. 
           I am hoping to use some of those traits to become a good developer. Game developers will usually work with a creative team on 
           graphic design, theme, characters and level design and layouts. Software developers will then take these ideas and design, develop and test the software
           making sure it meets the needs of the game's vision. I have an artistic eye so I am hoping that my years of experience in art, and my new training in software development
           will help reach my goals in becomming a game developer.

          Hello! My name is Kao Saelor, and I am a Marine Corps veteran who recently graduated with a Master's degree in
          Finance. I'm presently dedicated to pursuing a career as a software developer with a particular focus on
          crafting financial applications that can simplify and streamline financial management for both individuals and
          businesses. My intention is to design user-friendly and efficient applications that can cater to a wide range
          of financial needs and goals.<br><br>
          I would describe myself as someone who loves the outdoors and exploring new places. One of my favorite
          activities is fly fishing, which combines my passion for the outdoors with the challenge of learning a new
          skill. I find great joy in catching a fish on a fly I tied myself, and I'm always looking for a new river or
          stream to explore. Fly fishing is a great way to connect with nature and relax, and it's an activity that I
          can do year-round. I'm always eager to try new techniques and improve my skills, and I'm always looking for
          new spots to fish.
