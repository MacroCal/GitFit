## Conflict Plan

Conflict resolution is essential for a successful team agreement plan. This plan outlines strategies to address and resolve conflicts within the team, creating an environment of collaboration and understanding.

**1. Communicate Openly:** The first step to handling conflict in a group is to encourage open communication. Everyone should feel comfortable talking openly and honestly about their thoughts and feelings on the issue.

**2. Respect Each Other:** It’s important to remember to respect each other’s opinions, even if you don’t agree. Everyone should feel heard and respected.

**3. Find Common Ground:** When it comes to resolving conflict, it’s important to look for areas of agreement. Find common ground and build on it.

**4. Listen and Acknowledge:** Listening and acknowledging each other’s viewpoints is key to resolving conflict. This will help each person feel heard and understood.

**5. Come to a Resolution:** Once everyone has had their say, it’s time to come to a resolution. Brainstorm potential solutions and agree on the best one.

**6. Follow Through:** Once a resolution is agreed upon, everyone should commit to following through on it. This will help ensure that the conflict is resolved and won’t resurface.

**7. Use Mediator:** If conflict cannot be resolved within the team, we will use the instructor as mediator.

We will use Slack for any after hours communication.

**What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?**

Encourage open dialogue, listen actively and provide an equal opportunity for all to speak.

## Work Plan

At the beginning of each day, the team members will convene for a meeting to ensure that everyone is informed of the latest developments and to address any concerns. Additionally, we will review the plan for the day during this meeting. Furthermore, there will be follow-up meetings during lunchtime and at the end of each workday.

## Presentation Deck

We will use a presentation deck template to quickly create a visually appealing and organized presentation. The template includes professionally designed slides with placeholders to add text, images, and other elements, making it easier to create a polished presentation in less time.

Our general GitHub process are as follows:

1. Create a new repository for the project.
2. All members add the repository to their local environment.
3. Each member makes a branch and works on a specific task.
4. Merge all changes to the main branch after all tasks are complete.
